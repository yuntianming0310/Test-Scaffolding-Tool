# Tiny_Scaffolding_Tool

> 😁 Just for fun...

I have a idea for build a mini-program framework many days, but I don't know how to do that 🥲.
So that just try a simple way to create a simple framework in html.
Well, just for test my idea, and uhn, that's cool, really awesome way to do that, really enjoy the process in doing this tiny tool. 😋

Maybe I need more and more knowledge to really build a framework on my own 🤓

**Passion! Go ahead!😼**
